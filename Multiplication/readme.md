 # The Multiplication Algorithms
 * Given the area and resource usage of array multipliers, multiplication algorithms can
    be implemented using multicycle datapath
 * There are many multicycle multiplication algorithms, each trading off b/n area, 
    number of cycles till completion, cycle time and power.
 * This repo contains a number of implementations of such algorithms
